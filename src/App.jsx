      <h3>What is UX?</h3>
      <p>
        Simply put, user experience design is the process of planning the
        experience a person has when they interact with a product.UX design
        focuses on the interaction that a human user has with everyday products
        and services. The goal of UX design is to make using these products and
        services, both digital or physical, easy, logical, and fun.

      <h3>What is UI?</h3>
      <p>
        UI (User Interface) design is the user-centered approach to designing
        the aesthetics of a digital product. In essence, they create the look
        and feel of a website or applicationâ€™s user interface. An interface is
        the graphical layout of the application. These interfaces should not
        only be functional, but they should be easy to use and visually
        appealing.
